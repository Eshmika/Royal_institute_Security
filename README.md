# Royal_institute_Security

Royal Academy Education Institute is an institute management system designed to manage institute educational activities efficiently. This is a web-based application that was developed mainly based on eight functions, including user management, financial management, enrollment and attendance management, class management, lesson material management, timetable management, salary management, Q&A and feedback management. Through the use of the Royal Academy Education Institute, it helps students and teachers interact in a convenient manner, and it also helps managers and administrators manage institute tasks effectively and reliably. . We are using the MERN stack to implement this project. We are using the MERN stack to implement this project.

## CORS hardening

- Server now enforces a CORS allowlist using `CORS_ORIGINS` (comma-separated), defaulting to `http://localhost:3000`. Examples:

PowerShell (current session only):

```powershell
$env:CORS_ORIGINS = "http://localhost:3000,https://yourdomain.example"
```

CMD:

```bat
set CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://yourdomain.example
```

- Frontend dev server (CRA on port 3000) is configured via `frontend/craco.config.js` to avoid sending `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. Use `npm start` from `frontend/` to apply this behavior.

### Verify locally

Use curl to check headers:

```
curl -i http://localhost:5000/ -H "Origin: http://localhost:3000"
curl -i http://localhost:3000/ -H "Origin: http://localhost:3000"
```

Expected: No wildcard `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. Server should reflect allowed origin or block.

## Anti-clickjacking (dev server)

- The React dev server on port 3000 now sets anti-clickjacking headers via `frontend/craco.config.js`:
  - `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`
  - `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self'`

Verify with:

```powershell
curl.exe -i http://localhost:3000/ | findstr /I "x-frame-options content-security-policy"
```

## Private IP disclosure

- Dev build source maps are disabled via `frontend/craco.config.js` to reduce risk of private IPs being embedded in `bundle.js`.
- Dev server host and HMR WebSocket hostname are pinned to `localhost`.

Verify with:

```powershell
curl.exe http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js | findstr /R "\<10\.[0-9]\|\<192\.168\.|\<172\.(1[6-9]|2[0-9]|3[0-1])\."
```

Expected: no matches.

## Suppress X-Powered-By

- The API server disables Expressâ€™ `X-Powered-By` via `app.disable('x-powered-by')`.
- The CRA dev server (port 3000) removes `X-Powered-By` in `frontend/craco.config.js` using `setupMiddlewares`.

Verify:

```powershell
curl.exe -i http://localhost:5000/ | findstr /I "x-powered-by"
curl.exe -i http://localhost:3000/ | findstr /I "x-powered-by"
```

Expected: no `X-Powered-By` header in either response.

## Private IP disclosure (dev)

Some dev setups embed the local network IP in the webpack dev server client (HMR) code, which can appear in `http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js`.

Mitigation added:

- `frontend/craco.config.js` forces dev server `host` and client WebSocket hostname to `localhost`.
- `frontend/.env.development` sets `HOST` and `WDS_SOCKET_HOST` to `localhost`.

Verify:

- Start the frontend with `npm start` in `frontend/`.
- Fetch the bundle and search for private IPs:
  ```powershell
  curl.exe -s http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js | Select-String -Pattern '10\.|192\.168\.|172\.(1[6-9]|2[0-9]|3[0-1])\.'
  ```
  Expect no matches.
